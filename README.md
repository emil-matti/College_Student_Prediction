Data science is the process with programming while using mathematical and statistical methods to pull meaningful insight from data. From recommended music playlists to sports statistics, data science/econometric modeling are playing a significant role in human society today. Linear regression is one of the simplest and most commonly used statistical techniques and algorithms applied in the real-world. Using data science and machine learning algorithms help the world make better decisions based on the computer's findings. I have connected my econometric and machine learning background to implement a linear regression and exploratory data analysis on the decision of a student during the current pandemic. Data was collected through an electronic survey on google form and was sent out through the Wagner College student mailing list. SPSS was used to run the regression and collect statistical data on the variables used. Python, which is a high level programming language, was used to clean the data, provide visualizations and apply machine learning through a series of libraries within python. The regression run on the dataset and testing dataset achieved scores ranging from 55-59.9%. This end-to-end experiment provides the ease of understanding of modern analytics on a real-world problem.
